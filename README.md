Current Github repository supports [100-mice database](https://zenodo.org/records/14989998). Files `Complete_overview.txt` and `Truncdated_overview_codes.txt` describe folder trees for the whole repository and codes respectively.

The repository includes three folders 

* Clustering. Covers Functional Connectivity (FC)-based clustering of the rsfMRI data and corresponding analysis. Refer to `README-clustering.txt` for the instructions
* Cluster_perturbation_analysis. Describes the analysis of FC changes upon an external chemogenetic perturbation. Uses the data from [Rocchi et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28591-3#Sec9). Refer to `README_cluster_perturbation_analysis.txt` for the instructions
* Histological_evaluation. Supports cluster perturbation analysis and describes the quantitaive analysis and visualization of the viral expression. Refer to `README_Histological_evaluation.txt` for the instructions
